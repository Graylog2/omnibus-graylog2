Graylog Omnibus Project
========================
This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for
`Graylog`!

Download
--------
You can download Graylog stable as _Ubuntu_ package [here](https://packages.graylog2.org/releases/graylog2-omnibus/ubuntu/graylog_latest.deb)

Or Graylog beta/rc build from [here](https://packages.graylog2.org/releases/graylog-omnibus/ubuntu/graylog_beta.deb)

Installation
------------
You must have a sane Ruby 1.9+ environment with Bundler installed. Ensure all
the required gems are installed:

```shell
$ sudo bundle install --binstubs
```

Usage
-----
### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ sudo bin/omnibus build graylog
```

Currently we support only Ubuntu 14.04

### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with
the `clean` command:

```shell
$ sudo bin/omnibus clean graylog
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the
build including the project install directory (`/opt/graylog`) and
the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ sudo bin/omnibus clean graylog --purge
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the
`help` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus help
```
